# Asteroids-

Project Overview

Your Asteroids game in Python will feature a single spaceship. The spaceship can rotate left and right as well as accelerate forward. When it’s not accelerating, it will continue moving with the velocity it had. The spaceship can also shoot bullets.

The game will use the following key mappings:
Key 	Action
Right 	Rotate the spaceship right
Left 	Rotate the spaceship left
Up 	Accelerate the spaceship forward
Space 	Shoot
Esc 	Exit the game

There will also be six big asteroids in the game. When a bullet hits a big asteroid, it will split into two medium ones. When a bullet hits a medium asteroid, it will split into two small ones. A small asteroid won’t split but will be destroyed by a bullet.

When an asteroid collides with the spaceship, the spaceship will be destroyed, and the game will end in a defeat. When all asteroids are gone, the game will end in a victory!
